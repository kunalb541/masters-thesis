\section*{Acknowledgments}

I would like to express my sincere gratitude to my supervisors, Prof.~Dr.~Joachim Wambsganß and Dr.~Yiannis Tsapras, for their guidance, support, and valuable insights throughout this research. Their expertise in gravitational microlensing and computational astrophysics has been instrumental in shaping this work.

I am grateful to the members of the Astronomisches Rechen-Institut (ARI) for providing a stimulating research environment and for the many fruitful discussions that contributed to this thesis.

Special thanks to the OGLE and MOA survey teams for making their data publicly available, enabling the validation work presented in this thesis.

Finally, I thank my family and friends for their unwavering support and encouragement during my studies.
